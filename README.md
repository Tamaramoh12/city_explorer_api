## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
whenever you start learning web development you start dealing with the front-end, in other words, the interfaces using HTML & CSS and other things. after that you start to deal with data by learning a programming language and applying its operation and methods, and this the back-end side. At the beginning of the back-end practicing, we apply it on the browser or the client-side, but at a specific point, you have to convert from the browser to server because you can't load heavy data on the browsers. so we're working here to build a server and send and get data from it using node js.
